[ZoomManager](https://github.com/kerner1000/javafx-chart-zooming/blob/master/src/main/java/com/silicosciences/javafx/charts/zooming/ZoomManager.java) for JavaFX charts. Its a first draft but already working great! It can be easily applied to existing chart applications and lets you do zooming in and out painlessly.

Check out the [examples](https://github.com/kerner1000/javafx-chart-zooming)!
