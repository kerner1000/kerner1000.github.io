# 1 Don't try

> The key to a good life is not giving a f* about more; it's giving a f* about less, giving a f* about only what is true and immediate and important.

### Feedback Loop from Hell

The *Feedback Loop from Hell* means you are becoming anxious about being anxious and angry at yourself for being angry, for example.

> We have so much f* stuff and so many opportunities that we don't even know what to give a f* about anymore.

> The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience.

> *Alan Watts* used to refer to this as *the backwards law* - The idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become.

> You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.

Albert Camus

> Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associcated negative experience.

**Accept negative emotions as part of life.**

### The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*

#### Subtlety #1
> Not giving a f* does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.
> The point isn't to get away from the s*. The point is to find the s* you enjoy dealing with.

#### Subtlety #2
> To not give a f* about adversity, you mist first give a f* about something more important than adversity.

It is impossible to not give a f* at all. And you have a limited number of f*s to give. Therefore, choose wisely. 

**Simplify your life by choosing carefully only a very few f*s. Less is More. Lose and let go.**
